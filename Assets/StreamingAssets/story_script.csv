dialogue;You are sitting at your desk in your office, located in London, England. Your desk is relatively clean, with only your usual notepad and pen on it. On it are notes you usually write to keep track of details from previous cases.;;;;;
dialogue;Suddenly, the phone starts ringing. You quickly pick it up and bring it to your ear.;;;;;
dialogue;“Hello? Are you the private consultant I’ve heard so much about? Ah, good, I have the right number then. A client of mine has said a lot about you and how effective you are at your job.”;;;;;
dialogue;“They claimed that you were one of the best private consultants with expertise in forensics out there, is that true?”;;;;;

dialogue;You hear the rustling of papers on the other side of the phone.;;;;;
dialogue;“So, I guess I should start with some background details.”;;;;;
dialogue;“A day ago, March 7th, the corpse of one Winston Payne, male, 48, was found in a back alleyway between the local general goods store ‘The Good Generals’, and a ceramic ware shop ‘Potter Pots Pots.’”;;;;;
dialogue;“From some anonymous citizens, I have learned that he isn’t particularly well off, and works at ‘The Good Generals.’ He works there as a cleaner and cashier, and it was his employer who found him in that alleyway after he failed to get back to the cash register after his lunch break.”;;;;;
dialogue;“After some investigation on my own, I have narrowed down our suspects to three people.”;;;;;
dialogue;“James Baker, male, 27, owns and runs a family legacy bakery just four blocks away from the crime scene. When I was questioning him, he outright stated that he was not too hung up on Mr. Payne’s demise. He even said ‘good riddance’ afterward.”;;;;;
dialogue;“Jagger Carpenter, male, 28, runs a woodwork shop three blocks from the crime scene. When I questioned him, he was highly irritable and bad-tempered.”;;;;;
dialogue;“Finally, Andrew Potter, male, 63, a ceramist. The ceramics shop next to the crime scene is his. When I interrogated him, his eyes bore into mine, unblinkingly, and his tone was always rather ... excited shall we say. He just has this very unsettling atmosphere around him, gives me the creeps.”;;;;;
dialogue;“All three suspects were seen in close proximity to the alleyway within an hour of the estimated time of murder.”;;;;;

Mr. Baker is known for having no tolerance for thieves and has publicly called out to Mr. Payne to buy something or leave, even once or twice claiming that he saw Mr. Payne smuggle something out of his shop. Generally, people think he’s a strict, but fair person.”;“Mr. Payne visits Mr Baker’s bakery quite often but usually doesn’t end up buying anything. Customers have seen him verbally chase Mr. Payne out of his shop a few times now. Mr. Baker is known for complaining about thieves, and with how he treats Mr. Payne, possibly believes he is a thief. People clearly see that he does not like Payne.”;;;;
state_dialogue;“Mr. Carpenter has been down on his luck the past year. His business is at an all-time low, and because of it, he has lashed out verbally at many of his customers, a few times close to physically. Generally, people are weary and moderately scared about approaching him.”;“Mr. Carpenter is known to have a short temper recently due to poor luck regarding his business. He does not treat his customers respectfully, and customers usually leave his shop with scathing remarks following them. Generally, people consider him rather rude and would rather not approach him.”;;;;
state_dialogue;“Potter is known for practicing occultism. His shop blatantly has strange circles and ominous black symbols painted all over. He advertises that his pottery has special effects. Customers who enter his shop often hear incoherent mumbling in the backroom, presumably from Potter.”;“Mr. Potter is known to dabble in occultism, and his shop feels dark and ominous to customers. The shop itself as well as the pots on display have strange black symbols all over them.”;;;;
state_dialogue;“One citizen even claims that she snuck into the backroom and saw an open book with unnaturally grotesque images in it, but refused to say more. Generally, people are majorly creeped out by him and slightly fearful.”;“Some customers have even stated that they have heard suspicious noises coming from the backroom.

state_choice_3;Citizens say Baker is a fair person, and Payne has not done enough to push Baker to murder.;Carpenter is the suspect most prone to physical violence.;Potter's occultist nature makes him unpredictable. I believe him to be the most dangerous.;Baker is the only suspect with a proper motive against Payne specifically.;Carpenter, although short-tempered and rude, hasn’t actually physically hurt anyone.;Potter’s belief in the unnatural makes him unpredictable. You never know what he is and isn't willing to do.

state_path_3;“Yes, I completely agree with that.”;“Yes, with his recent attitude and actions, he is the most likely to harm another.”;“I don't really believe in the supernatural, but if he does, then he is certainly dangerous in his own way.”;“While that is true, I'd rather not believe that Mr. Baker would resort to murder over dubious thievery.”;“Yes, but from my judgement, he's still the most likely of the suspects to resort to violence.”;“I don't believe in the supernatural, but if he believes in it, then that would make him quite dangerous.”

dialogue;“Moving on, in order to learn more about the suspects, I looked into past reports of these suspects in other cases to see if they have criminal records of any kind. Naturally, a criminal past may indicate a criminal present.”;;;;;

state_dialogue;“Mr. Baker has a few cases where customers tried to get him arrested for poisoning them with his baked goods. However, none of these cases were proven true.”;“Mr. Baker has a few cases where customers accused him of poisoning his baked goods. However, none of those accusations led anywhere, and the customers abruptly stopped their accusations soon after. Since none of the accusations stuck, his criminal records look relatively clean.”;;;;
state_dialogue;“It was also noted that almost all of the accusers were frequent customers of a rival bakery and were later fined or arrested for false accusations. Despite the rather obvious attempt to falsely discredit Mr. Baker, these cases were still added to his records. I can’t imagine Mr. Baker being very pleased about that.”;“Mr. Carpenter has been in a few cases where he verbally assaulted former customers in public for no longer buying from his store. One of the cases almost turned into a case of physical assault, which ended up on his criminal record.”;;;;
state_dialogue;“Mr. Carpenter has had a good few cases where he verbally assaulted his former customers in public when he saw them enter a competitor’s store. He screamed profanities and insults at them about being traitors and scum for no longer buying his services, before stomping away, fuming.”;“Potter hasn’t had many terrible cases. He mostly has police files about him and his questionable practices in the occult, where customers complain about him and his shop being excessively disturbing and unnatural. Curiously, despite all these complaints about his obsession with the occult, he has no strong criminal record.”;;;;
state_dialogue;“There is one record where he almost resorted to physical violence with a former customer who shouted back. Mr. Carpenter grabbed his former customer’s shirt collar and threatened to punch him with his fist raised. He was promptly tackled by a couple of cops and arrested. He was fined for causing a public disturbance and attempted assault.”;skip;;;;
state_dialogue;“Mr. Potter doesn’t have any major cases on file. He mostly has police files about faint suspicions from former and present customers that he’s doing something suspicious in the back of his shop. Enough have complained about him to warrant a full search of his shop, but no actual evidence was found of him harming anyone or doing anything else illegal.”;skip;;;;
dialogue;“What do you think? Anything that stands out to you? Any inclinations to crime?”;;;;;
state_choice_3;The accusations against Baker were clear acts of sabotage. I think we can say his criminal record is invalid.;Carpenter has the most notable criminal record. His case is also the only one involving physical violence.;Potter seems to be strongly mistrusted by his customers, but there is no evidence for anything illegal. He's relatively clean.;All of Baker's accusers suddenly went silent. Baker may have done something to “pacify” the accusers.;Carpenter has the most solid criminal record, and seems the most prone to violence.;"Potter has no strong criminal record despite his connection with occultism. Perhaps he used his ""magic"" to remove evidence."

state_path_3;“I quite agree with your train of thought. He seems to have the least suspicious record of the three.”;“Being the most violent of the suspects is definitely a strike against him. He also seems to have the most violent mindset of the three suspects.”;“I feel like the results of his cases were more inconclusive than anything, but I digress.”;“I hadn’t thought of that. Although not directly stated on his criminal record, I suppose that is a possible point of suspicion. I find it rather unlikely, though.”;“Yes, he is the most suspicious to me as well for the same reasons.”;“I’m not a believer in the occult myself, so I can't really believe that.

dialogue;“Moving on, our next clue is from a witness from the day of the murder.”;;;;;
dialogue;“On the day of the murder, one citizen near the alley witnessed a dark-coated figure rush out of that alleyway around the estimated time of the murder. Normally, this would have been a huge clue to narrowing down the suspect, especially if they managed to remember any distinct features of that figure.”;;;;;
dialogue;“Unfortunately, the witness had poor eyesight and didn’t see any other identifying features, nor could they make a better description of the coloring of the coat. They just said that the figure was wearing a dark, if not black, coat.”;;;;;
dialogue;“Still, I decided to interrogate each suspect about what they were wearing that day and searched their houses and shops for anything suspicious as well as those clothes.”;;;;;

state_dialogue;“All suspects were all wearing grey coats that day. Normally this would be pointless to consider a clue, but Baker and Carpenter were wearing dark grey coats while Potter was wearing a slightly lighter grey coat covered in strange black symbols.”;“Unfortunately, there’s not much to say. All suspects were wearing grey coats that day, though I suppose something of note is that Potter’s had a strange black pattern on it.”;;;;
state_dialogue;“What do you think? You think these details are important enough to take note of?”;“What do you think? Anything that seems vitally important?”;;;;
state_choice_3;Baker and Carpenter match the description better than Potter since they were wearing darker grey coats.;Potter's lighter coat was covered in darker symbols, perhaps the witness’ poor eyesight mixed the colors to make a darker color.;There’s not enough information, all the coats are in some way or another visible as dark coats, especially with poor vision.;If they were all wearing grey, then we can’t decisively deduce anything.;The witness should have noticed the strange pattern on Potter’s coat, so it’s more likely one of the other two.;The black pattern on Potter’s coat may have tricked the witness into seeing a darker coat since they had poor eyesight.

Still, it seems like a bit of a stretch, but I will note that down.”;“Yeah, that’s what I thought as well. I think we should just discard this clue.”;“Yeah, this clue isn’t all that helpful. I too think we should discard it.”;“... alright, if you think so.”;“You know, I never considered that. Still, it seems like a bit of a stretch, but I will note that down.”

dialogue;“Anyways, moving on.”;;;;;
dialogue;“The next clue involves the murder weapon, or rather, lack thereof. The crime scene did not have any objects lying around that indicated use for murderous intent. Instead, we can only deduce the tool of murder from the wounds on Mr. Payne’s body.”;;;;;
dialogue;“Mr. Payne’s body has numerous long cuts all over his upper body, including torso, arms, and head. The wounds indicate many slash attacks were used rather than any stab attacks, and that each slash is surprisingly shallow.”;;;;;
dialogue;“To me, these kinds of wounds indicate that the murder weapon was a knife of some sort. When I searched the suspect’s houses and shops, I carefully confiscated all the knives. Unfortunately, no knives had blood, traces, or any other signs of being used for murder. Each house had the necessary chemicals to erase those signs, or the murderer could have disposed of their weapon.”;;;;;
dialogue;“I’ve narrowed the knives down to one from each suspect that seemed most likely to have caused the wounds on Mr. Payne’s body.”;;;;;
dialogue;“Mr. Baker’s is a bread knife, Mr. Carpenter’s is a whittling knife, and Mr. Potter’s is a clay cutting knife.”;;;;;
dialogue;“It’s somewhat difficult to exactly describe the knives in detail, so I’ve sent some replicas to you. I actually sent them to you with quick delivery when we first started talking, so they should have arrived to you by now. Look around you, they should be in a box with red tape. Take some time to examine them.”;;;;;

state_choice_3;The whittling knife Carpenter uses is so short that it would be impractical to use it for stabbing and incapable of causing deep cuts. It matches the wounds.;Baker’s bread knife is relatively wide and long. It’s too large to cause the shallow wounds on the victim’s body.;Potter’s clay knife is long and narrow with a sharp tip. It would be better for stabbing than slashing. It doesn’t match the wounds.;The whittling knife Carpenter uses is quite thin and short. It doesn’t look like it would be particularly good for making fatal slash wounds.;Baker’s bread knife is the largest and most dangerous knife. Its tip also makes it impractical for stabbing, meaning it is better for slashing.;Potter’s clay knife looks too thin and fragile for making slash wounds without quickly breaking. It’s better suited for stabbing.

state_path_3;“On that, I completely agree. A strange weapon to use, but it matches the wounds the most.”;“Indeed, it would cause much larger wounds than the ones observed on the victim’s body.”;“Yes, that and it would likely snap with how thin the blade is, whether it is used for slashing or stabbing.”;“Hmm, in my experience, anything with a sharp edge or point can be a lethal cutting weapon. A pen could be a lethal cutting weapon if used correctly.”;“It certainly matches some of the wounds descriptions but I feel like it's a tad large for the wounds described on Mr. Payne's body.”;“Yes, that’s what I thought as well. Great minds think alike, right?”

dialogue;“Mr. Baker bought a whetstone, undoubtedly to sharpen his knives. Mr. Carpenter bought a bundle of small blades, which were used to replace his whittling knife’s blade once it had become too dull. Mr. Potter bought some mugwort, which is a medicinal herb used as an anesthetic, and has ties to occultist rituals.”;;;;;

While it’s a rather odd place for it to be, my suspicion is that the receipt book was an object of interest for the murderer and that they took it from Payne’s corpse. However, as they were running from the crime scene, they accidentally dropped it.”;“It seems to be originally held by Mr. Payne since the hours before his murder were his cashier hours. The general store manager told me as much since he trusted Payne with how he handled the cash register. My conjecture is that Payne was murdered to obtain that receipt book, possibly to dispose of the book for objects they bought in the past.”;“Give me a second.”;“It was found near the entrance of the alleyway, and quite battered. Though I wonder if there was a reason for why it was located at the entrance, a distance away from the actual murder, and in bad condition to boot.”;“It seems to be originally held by Mr. Payne since the hours before his murder were his cashier hours.

state_choice_3;Baker buying a whetstone could point to him sharpening his knives, which would make cutting down a victim easier.;Carpenter buying a set of interchangeable blades would make disposing of bloody blades easier.;If the murderer took the book to erase evidence of a suspicious purchase, it might be Potter since he purchased an herb that acts as a sedative.;Both Baker’s and Carpenter’s objects are related to their suspected murder weapons, so they are more suspicious than Potter.;None of this matters, since all the purchases could be justified to be completely normal.;Potter’s item, mugwort, is the only object that isn’t relevant to this case.

state_path_3;“That's true, I suppose.
